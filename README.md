# üßÆ SQL Production Data Analysis

## Overview
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to explore and analyze large-scale production data across multiple food categories such as **milk, coffee, honey, cheese, eggs, and yogurt**.  
The goal is to apply analytical SQL techniques to discover patterns, identify trends, and generate meaningful insights from raw data.

The project was created as a practical exercise in **data analysis, query optimization, and database reporting**.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Explore production data using SQL.
- Perform aggregation, filtering, and comparative analysis.
- Understand data distribution across years and states.
- Create reusable analytical queries for reporting purposes.

---

## üß© Project Structure
- `1part_final_project.sql` ‚Äî initial setup and basic queries.  
- `2part_final_project.sql` ‚Äî advanced analysis, joins, and conditional logic.  
- Example outputs are provided for key analytical questions.
